both by land and other factors will not meet the increasing food demand unless
agricultural systems are improved. According to FAO, almost 690 million people in the
world (8.9 percent of the world population) are estimated to have been undernourished
in 2019.</p>

consumption and disposal of food products that originate from agriculture, forestry or
fisheries, and parts of the broader economic, societal and natural environments in which
they are embedded.</p>

Resilience can be defined as the ability of people, households, communities, countries,

that reduces chronic vulnerability and facilitates inclusive growth is critical.</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Resilience building relies on integrated programming—across-sectoral approach with a
long-term commitment to improving the three critical capacities: absorptive capacity
(disaster risk management), adaptive capacity (longer-term livelihood investments), and
transformative capacity (improved governance and enabling conditions).</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Our integrated approach ensures that partners and sectors work together to address
key leverage points and adopt complementary, synergistic strategies that will ultimately
strengthen resilience at all levels.</p>

Sector Development (PSD) covers a range of strategies aiming to establish markets that
