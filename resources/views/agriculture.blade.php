                    <p class="mb-4">The global population will surpass 9 Billion by 2050, while agricultural production limited
both by land and other factors will not meet the increasing food demand unless
agricultural systems are improved. According to FAO, almost 690 million people in the
world (8.9 percent of the world population) are estimated to have been undernourished
in 2019.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Food systems (FS) encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-
adding activities involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution,
consumption and disposal of food products that originate from agriculture, forestry or
fisheries, and parts of the broader economic, societal and natural environments in which
they are embedded.</p>

<p class="mb-4">In the context of rapid population growth, urbanization, growing wealth, changing
consumption patterns, and globalization as well as climate change and the depletion of
natural resources, adoption of food systemâ€™s approach is critical.</p>
