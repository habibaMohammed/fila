                        The livestock sector in Kenyan economy contributes about 12% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 40% to the agricultural GDP and employs about 50% of the work force in agriculture and about 90% of the ASAL workforce and contributes 95% of household income for people living in the ASAL areas (Ministry of Livestock Development, 2010; Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MAL&F), 2015). Figure 1 shows the stock of livestock in Kenya during 2010-2019.</p>

In Wajir county, thousands of the rural population depend mainly on their livestock as source of food and income however changing climatic patterns, increased animal disease has affected animal productivity.

                        <p class="mb-4">The ICREP project sought to build resilient model villages using both need and right based approaches in socio-economic strengthening. The project worked directly with 5535 households including smallholder farmers, fishers, traders, pastoralists, youth, and women in Kilifi and Mandera Counties. It will also support school children with an aim to improve enrolment, retention, and transition. Communities in target locations are vulnerable to climatic shocks, specifically drought, which combined with low productivity and a lack of access to markets and financial services has resulted in low-income security and widespread poverty. </p>
<p class="mb-4">
In conducting the end line evaluation, Filatec utilized a mixed approach of quantitative assessment and qualitative interviews to answer evaluation questions. The Quantitative component comprised a review of existing secondary data sources e.g., surveys and existing databases where available to identify existing data and gaps in knowledge, and metrics that can be used for VFM assessment. For the qualitative assessment, a range of interviewees were selected to represent the views of stakeholders at different levels, and different target beneficiary groups. </p>

While the unemployment rate varies by country, it reaches as high as 70% in some African countries. The high unemployment rate has forced African youth into economic migration every year, with hundreds of thousands trying to move out of the continent seeking jobs </p>
