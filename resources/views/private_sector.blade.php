                        <p>In recent years, donors have encouraged the implementation of private sector development
(PSD) initiative to support economic growth especially among the developing countries. Private
Sector Development (PSD) covers a range of strategies aiming to establish markets that
function vibrantly and fairly, providing economic opportunities of quality to poor people at scale.
In line with OCED’s approaches for PSD, Filatec expertise help implement inclusive
economic models that will create jobs, fuel income growth, and improve the quality of
life.</p>
